## Hey, I'm Chetas 👋

CS student at DY Patil International University, passionate about **DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and building real systems from scratch.**

I learn by doing — not tutorials, but actual projects that break in interesting ways.

## 🔧 What I'm working with
`Python` `Linux` `Docker` `FastAPI` `Nginx` `SQLite` `JavaScript` `Azure`

## 📦 Currently learning
`Kubernetes` `CI/CD (GitHub Actions)` `Computer Networks` `Operating Systems`

## 🚀 What I've built
- **Self-Hosted Home Cloud** — bare Linux server → Dockerized services → Nginx reverse proxy → personal cloud storage with auth and per-user quotas
- **Car Pooling Platform** — TypeScript-based ride sharing app
- **SafarSathi_App** — solution that leverages GPS and accelerometer data to automatically detect trips, capture travel details, and sync structured data for analysis. Under strict time constraints

## 🎯 Goal
Landing a **DevOps / Cloud Engineer** role where I can work on infrastructure, automation, and platform reliability.
